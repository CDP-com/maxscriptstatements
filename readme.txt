Max Script Statements
============
Description: This app allows you to change the value of the Windows registry setting that triggers browser prompts that inform the user of a script that is taking a long time to execute. It also allows or encourages the user to stop the execution of the script. This app sets the value to a value that will allow the scripts to run without the message. You can also change it back to the default value.
